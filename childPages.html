    <h2>About Me...</h2>
    <p2>My name is Kathir, and I was born on a small island called Sri Lanka. I come from a family of 5. I have 2 older brothers, who are 9 and 7 years older than me! I like to play basketball with friends, I mostly play the point guard position which is known for passing, and 3 point shooting. These are just a few of the many things about me!</p2>

  <p3>My ambition in life is to become a lawyer. It's always been a dream of mine. More specificially, a malpratice lawyer. A malpractice lawyer is pretty much a lawyer who works with hospitals, and helps out in the medical field overall. I'll become a lawyer and help as many hospitals as I can! </p3>
